#  PandemIQ covid-19 Vision


# PandemIQ Vision combines “Pandemic” and “IQ” (intelligence) with “Vision” — suggesting a smart, insightful way to analyze pandemic data.

“PandemIQ” implies intelligent pandemic analysis — not just raw numbers, but understanding patterns, trends, and insights in COVID-19 data.

“Vision” emphasizes visualization and foresight — using charts, dashboards, predictive models, and analytics to see beyond the surface and interpret complex data clearly.

This name positions the project as a data-driven analytical system with intelligence and insight — not just a basic report. It conveys both technical depth and clarity of visualization.
